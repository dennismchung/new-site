              <p>As such we want to help students and teachers by providing family members (guardians, parents, etc.) ongoing views into student progress. Kiddom for Families V1 is our first MVP to accomplish this goal. There is extensive research to support the premise that student outcomes are improved through support at home. As such enabling access to student performance for families supports this.</p>

                <p>We came up with a home screen that will have show a list of the parents children, classes they are in, and a short summary of their progress. We knew that parents would want to quickly see how their child was doing from the research sessions.</p>

                <p>We actually encountered a technical constraint pitfall during development. Since this was a stand-alone feature of the product we were in uncharted territory. Initially, we wanted to have a combined view of all the classes and assignments a student had.</p>
                <p>However, the way our backend data was built made it very difficult to see assignments from multiple classes in one view. It would take around 30 seconds - 1 minute for data to load. Given the tight timeline, we decided to pivot to a single class view.</p>

                      <p>So users were able to achieve the tasks with ease. Some small minor confusion with our existing classroom UI. I documented the painpoints for the core product designer to review.</p>
                      <ol>
                        <li>2/5 users could not see the score of the assignment. 3/5 users did not know if the date was for when the assignment was due or assigned.</li>
                        <li>4/5 users were confused about what the weeks discriptor referred to.</li>
                        <li>3/5...</li>

              <h3>Conclusion</h3>
              <p>This project was one of my favorites to work on at Kiddom. Since this was a stand-alone feature (separate from the teacher and student experience) I was able to create something new and push our apps design boundaries. Things like: </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>How a parent would want to best navigate and view their children’s assignments</li>
                  <li>Creating a new intuitive way for parents to understand their childs grade.</li>
                </ul>
              <p>Some things planned for our future releases:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Fix our backend architecture so that student data would load quicker.</li>
                <li>Clearer visual language to understand a complex idea of Mastery.</li>
                <li>Teacher Parent communication </li>
                <li>Detailed behavioral/social progress. Note-taking and reporting etc.</li>
              </ul>
