              <p>As such we want to help students and teachers by providing family members (guardians, parents, etc.) ongoing views into student progress. Kiddom for Families V1 is our first MVP to accomplish this goal. There is extensive research to support the premise that student outcomes are improved through support at home. As such enabling access to student performance for families supports this.</p>

                <p>Multiple Schools who were using Kiddom and also potential clients expressed an interest in a parent and student portal. Kiddom chose to do a study at Marshall County school where we talked to parents, teachers, and students.</p>
